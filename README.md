Airbnb is an online platform that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodation in that neighbourhood. In this EDA project, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in the NewYork neighbourhood using basic exploratory data analysis techniques. We were provided with a single dataset. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between a categorical and numeric value. which has different information such as, host id, price of listing, words used, availability, reviews and many more.

As a first step, we perform data wrangling over the raw data. further we divided the complete project into different parts. Which is as follows: what can we learn about different hosts and areas, what we can learn from different types of features such as location, prices, reviews and availability, busiest host, traffic among different areas, and words used to search accommodation facilities. 

We will be finding out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name and related factors. 
                   
Through EDA, we identified that the largest number of listings are from Manhattan and Brooklyn, mostly consisting of full houses and private apartments. People prefer to rent homes when they cost between $50 to $200. Some of the terms used by the customer to locate the house for rent include location, view and type of rooms.
